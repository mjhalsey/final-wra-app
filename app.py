This process is simple and fast, and will give you peace of mind as you prepare for deployment. The questions and information provided have been drafted by Legal Assistance experts with years of experience helping Warfighters prepare for deployments.\n\nAnswering the questions below can help us understand what you are going through and whether you need legal assistance. These answers are not a substitute for legal advice, but they will give you an idea if you should contact an attorney. When you complete all the questions, the program will generate a checklist and instructions based on your responses. You can take that checklist to your local legal assistance office and the lawyers there will help you put together what you need, at no cost to you.\n\nPlease read each question carefully.\n\nLet’s get started……..",

It's not just for the wealthy; everyone has an \"estate.\" Estate planning answers these big questions: Who gets my stuff? (Your house, car, money, sentimental items). Who will take care of my kids? (Designating a guardian). Who will make medical decisions for me if I can't? (Healthcare power of attorney). The goal of estate planning is to make things as easy as possible for your Family during a difficult time, and an important part of an estate plan can be a will.",
            "popup": {"A Will": "A Will is the document that decides what you want to happen to your stuff. Think of it as the master instruction sheet for what to do with your things after you pass away. A Will does three main things: 1. It lists who gets your stuff. 2. It names a trusted person (sometime called your \"Executor\" or your “Personal Representative”) to be in charge of making sure your will is followed. 3. It names a Guardian if you have minor children - this is where you legally state who you want to raise them. Remember, no one can force you to get a will, and you are not required to have one before you deploy. These questions will tell you when it’s a really really good idea to make a will, but the choice is always yours. Later in the program we will talk about how to make sure all your benefits and accounts can be directed to where you want them to go with or without a will."},
